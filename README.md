# BookHub

BookHub is a project that I created when I was first starting to learn about html.
It was my attempt to build a platform where people could buy their favorite books.
At the time, I had very little programming experience, so the project was simple and had limited functionality.
Users could create an account, search for books, and leave reviews or comments on books they had read.
It was a very basic implementation of a social network centered around books.
Despite its simplicity, I learned a lot from working on BookHub.
I learned how to build a web application from scratch, and I gained valuable experience in front-end development.
